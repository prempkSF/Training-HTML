        <h2>Short Poem</h2>
        <h3>Weeping</h3>
        <p><i>Author James</i></p>
        <p> Let me pour forth<br>
            My tears before thy face, whilst I stay here,<br>
            For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they bear,<br>
            And by this mintage they are something worth,<br>
                     For thus they be<br>
                     Pregnant of thee;<br>
            Fruits of much grief they are, emblems of more,<br>
            When a tear falls, that thou falls which it bore,<br>
            So thou and I are nothing then, when on a diverse shore.<hr></p>
        <h3>String Bass</h3>
        <p><i>Author Rack Burns</i></p>
        <p> Some like to dominate,<br>
            others caress<br>
            a voluptuous rhythm<br>
            on pliant strings.<br>
            
            
            This pulse drives life<br>
            through wanton counterpoint,<br>
            the heart and harmony<br>
            of things.<hr></p>
